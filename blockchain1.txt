Q1:
what is block chan?

Block chain is a huge network of blocks associated with the lots of data.
which is to secured via secured hashing algorithm and it ensures safety of data 





Q2:
problem resolving:

Block chain trying to solve the involvement of third parties in the transaction of dat/money and also ensures to maintain security



Q3:Features:


verifiability,unchangeable,immutable,secured(tamper proof)





Q4:

block :
block contains  -->block number
		-->data 
		-->previous key/signature(if genesis block starting key)
		-->next key(key generated by own [mining key])
		

Q5:
verifiability is to  ensure  that the data has distributed correctly and with the same data and key the hash generated will be same inorder to say it is distributed if not that is not a true document
for achieving verifiability one has to make sure that the data and key he has is same as all.
